# tanglespam

Scripts for different types of spam, not the most efficient spammer

`npm i`

`node goodspam`

Set your node in config.json

console.logs are commented out for better performance, so don't expect an output for every script

Small changes can have a big impact on the result, so edit the scripts and try different values
